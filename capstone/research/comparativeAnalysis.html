    <!-- <h2>Poptropica</h2>
    <img>
    <p>Poptropica is a game for kids to explore and complete quests on virutal themed islands. The overall user experience is easy to use as everything is done by clicking and dragging. Some movements may be frustrating though, such as making the character drop below a platform. The UI is friendly and colorful, making it perfect for its game content and for its young audience. The game is depends heavily on its stories because each island has its own theme, quest, and mystery, all of which informs the visuals of a specific island and the personalities of NPCs within it. However, younger kids may not completely understand or pay attention to these narratives as they are mainly focused on the gameplay and visuals.
