    <h2>My Findings</h2>
    <p>
        My user journey was clear in conveying what my project was, how users would interact with it, and in what situations they would come across it. Most of the questions that came up were about the feasibility of the project. Kris recommended creating the project about one specific topic so it can be used alongside school material that already exists. He also brought up concerns about accessibilty because some users may have access to a desktop at school or at home. If they do, their devices are likely all different sizes, so the size of my canvas may affect the gameplay experience. To remedy this, Kris suggested to have the game be container in a fixed canvas that fits all screens.

        If I were to change my user journey, I would clarify that the review worksheet that goes along with my project is something from the existing curriculum. I'm not sure if the worksheet should be introduced before the game because that might make the game feel more like a chore rather than a fun learning activity masked. Students might speed through it to look for answers rather than exploring and learning at their own pace.
